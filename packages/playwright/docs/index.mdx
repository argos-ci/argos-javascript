# Use Argos with Playwright

Integrating Argos with your [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) tests to enable visual testing on your application.

Playwright already offers a command to take screenshots. The official Argos Playwright integration uses it but also does several things:

- Wait for all images to be loaded
- Wait for all fonts to be loaded
- Wait for no `aria-busy` (loader) elements to be present in the page
- Hide scrollbars
- Hide carets
- Expose CSS helpers to help you hiding content

## 1. Setup

```
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/playwright @playwright/test
```

## 2. Use in your tests

`argosScreenshot` command stabilizes the UI and takes a screenshot.

_How to take a screenshot with `argosScreenshot` command_

```js
import { test } from "@playwright/test";
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/playwright";

test.describe("Homepage", () => {
  test("take screenshot", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto(TEST_URL);
    await argosScreenshot(page, "homepage");
  });
});
```

Screenshots are stored in `./screenshots` folder.

## 3. Upload screenshots to Argos

Look at Argos doc to know [how to configure your CI](https://argos-ci.com/docs/upload-screenshots) to send screenshots to Argos.
