# Argos Puppeteer SDK

Integrating Argos with your [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) tests to enable visual testing on your application.

Puppeteer already offers a command to take screenshots. The official Argos Puppeteer integration uses it but also does several things:

- Ensuring all images are fully loaded.
- Ensuring all fonts are rendered.
- Confirming the absence of any `aria-busy` (loading) elements on the page.
- Concealing scrollbars.
- Obscuring text cursors or carets.
- Providing CSS utilities to simplify content hiding.

## Installation

### 1. Install package

```
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/cli @argos-ci/puppeteer
```

### 2. Use in your tests

`argosScreenshot` command stabilizes the UI and takes a screenshot.

_How to take a screenshot with `argosScreenshot` command_

```js
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/puppeteer";

describe("Integration test with visual testing", () => {
  it("loads the homepage", async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(TEST_URL);
    await argosScreenshot(page, this.test.fullTitle());
  });
});
```

Screenshots are stored in `screenshots/argos` folder, relative to current directory.

## API Overview

### argosScreenshot(page, name[, options])

- `page` - A `puppeteer` page instance
- `name` - The screenshot name; must be unique
- `options` - See [Page.screenshot command options](https://pptr.dev/next/api/puppeteer.page.screenshot/)
- `options.element` - Accept an ElementHandle or a string selector to screenshot an element
- `options.viewports` - Specifies the viewports for which to capture screenshots. See [viewports configuration](https://argos-ci.com/docs/viewports).
- `options.argosCSS`: Specific CSS applied during the screenshot process.

## Helper Attributes for Visual Testing

For tailored visual testing, the `data-visual-test` attributes provide control over how elements appear in Argos screenshots. This can be especially useful for obscuring or modifying elements with dynamic content, like dates.

- `[data-visual-test="transparent"]`: Renders the element transparent (`visiblity: hidden`).
- `[data-visual-test="removed"]`: Removes the element from view (`display: none`).
- `[data-visual-test="blackout"]`: Masks the element with a blackout effect.
- `[data-visual-test-no-radius]`: Strips the border radius from the element.

**Example: Using a helper attribute to hide a div from the captured screenshot:**

```html
<div id="clock" data-visual-test="transparent">...</div>
```
