# Use Argos with Puppeteer

Integrating Argos with your [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) tests to enable visual testing on your application.

Puppeteer already offers a command to take screenshots. The official Argos Puppeteer integration uses it but also does several things:

- Wait for all images to be loaded
- Wait for all fonts to be loaded
- Wait for no `aria-busy` (loader) elements to be present in the page
- Hide scrollbars
- Hide carets
- Expose CSS helpers to help you hiding content

## 1. Setup

```
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/cli @argos-ci/puppeteer
```

## 2. Use in your tests

`argosScreenshot` command stabilizes the UI and takes a screenshot.

_How to take a screenshot with `argosScreenshot` command_

```js
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/puppeteer";

describe("Integration test with visual testing", () => {
  it("loads the homepage", async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(TEST_URL);
    await argosScreenshot(page, this.test.fullTitle());
  });
});
```

Screenshots are stored in `screenshots/argos` folder, relative to current directory.

## 3. Upload screenshots to Argos

Look at Argos doc to know [how to configure your CI](https://argos-ci.com/docs/upload-screenshots) to send screenshots to Argos.
