# Argos Storybook SDK

Integrate visual testing with your Storybook seamlessly using Argos. This SDK allows you to capture and review visual changes in your Storybook components directly within your CI.

## Getting Started

To get started with Argos and Storybook, check out our [Storybook Quickstart Guide](/quickstart/storybook).

## Comparing Argos and Chromatic

While both Argos and Chromatic provide visual testing for Storybook, they take different approaches:

- **Argos** captures screenshots of your Storybook components **in your CI using Playwright**.
- **Chromatic** captures screenshots of your Storybook components **in the cloud**.

For a deeper comparison, see our [Argos vs Chromatic guide](https://argos-ci.com/compare/chromatic).
