# Argos Cypress SDK

Boost your visual testing capabilities by combining Argos with your [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) tests.

While Cypress inherently provides screenshot functionality, the Argos Cypress integration enhances this by:

- Ensuring all images are fully loaded.
- Ensuring all fonts are rendered.
- Confirming the absence of any `aria-busy` (loading) elements on the page.
- Concealing scrollbars.
- Obscuring text cursors or carets.
- Providing CSS utilities to simplify content hiding.
- Gives you visility on test failures.

## Get started

Please refer to our [Quickstart guide](/quickstart/cypress) to get started with Argos and Cypress.

## API Overview

### cy.argosScreenshot([name][, options])

- `name`: Unique name for the screenshot.
- `options`: Explore [cy.screenshot command options](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) for details.
- `options.element`: Use an ElementHandle or string selector to capture a specific element's screenshot.
- `options.viewports`: Define specific viewports for capturing screenshots. More on [viewports configuration](/viewports).
- `options.argosCSS`: Specific CSS applied during the screenshot process. More on [injecting CSS](/injecting-css)
- `options.threshold`: Sensitivity threshold between 0 and 1. The higher the threshold, the less sensitive the diff will be. Default to `0.5`.
- `options.stabilize`: Wait for the UI to stabilize before taking the screenshot. Set to `false` to disable stabilization. Pass an object to customize the stabilization. Default to `true`.
- `options.stabilize.ariaBusy`: Wait for the `aria-busy` attribute to be removed from the document. Default to `true`.
- `options.stabilize.fonts`: Wait for fonts to be loaded. Default to `true`.
- `options.stabilize.images`: Wait for images to be loaded. Default to `true`.

## Helper Attributes for Visual Testing

For tailored visual testing, the `data-visual-test` attributes provide control over how elements appear in Argos screenshots. This can be especially useful for obscuring or modifying elements with dynamic content, like dates.

- `[data-visual-test="transparent"]`: Renders the element transparent (`visiblity: hidden`).
- `[data-visual-test="removed"]`: Removes the element from view (`display: none`).
- `[data-visual-test="blackout"]`: Masks the element with a blackout effect.
- `[data-visual-test-no-radius]`: Strips the border radius from the element.

**Example: Using a helper attribute to hide a div from the captured screenshot:**

```html
<div id="clock" data-visual-test="transparent">...</div>
```

### registerArgosTask(on, config[, options])

- `on`: Cypress plugin events.
- `config`: Cypress config.
- `options`: All [upload parameters](https://js-sdk-reference.argos-ci.com/interfaces/UploadParameters.html).
- `options.uploadToArgos`: Upload results and create a build on Argos, `true` by default.

```ts title="cypress.config.js"
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");
const { registerArgosTask } = require("@argos-ci/cypress/task");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  // setupNodeEvents can be defined in either
  // the e2e or component configuration
  e2e: {
    async setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      registerArgosTask(on, config, {
        uploadToArgos: !!process.env.CI,
      });

      // include any other plugin code...
    },
  },
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error while importing `@argos-ci/cypress/task` in `cypress.config.ts`

To address the `ts(1479)` error when importing `@argos-ci/cypress/task` in your `cypress.config.ts`, you have two main strategies:

1. Update your `tsconfig.json` by setting `moduleResolution` to `"Bundler"`. This method leverages TypeScript's support for newer module resolution strategies, aligning with Node.js's `exports` feature used by Argos to distribute optimized SDKs.

2. Alternatively, suppress the error in `cypress.config.ts` by adding the line `// @ts-expect-error moduleResolution` right above the import statement. This tells TypeScript to expect an error at this line and ignore it, offering a quick workaround without adjusting your project's module resolution strategy.

The first option is a more comprehensive solution, dealing with the TypeScript bug through adopting the new `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` setting, which is designed for such cases. The second option is simpler and quicker but bypasses the issue rather than solving it at its core.
